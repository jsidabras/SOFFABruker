## Initial ProDEL file for SOFFA measurements	

This is a very basic ProDEL file for the Bruker XEPR that allows you to obtain segmented EPR spectra.

#### Basic Usage

On Bruker XEPR:

* Set up a new EPR experiment.
* Set the number of points to the highest available.
* Set your sweep time.
* Set your modulation amplitude.
* Set your time constant to the lowest available.
* Set your sweep width to the length of the segmented width.

In the ProDEL file:

* Set the step size in `parStep`
* Set the first field point in `value`. The field point should be the lowest field minus `parStep`.
* Set the last field point in `endParValue`.

#### Example
To set a 0.5 G step with a total field sweep of 100 G from 3250. to 3350 G.

`parStep` = 0.5
`value` = 3249.5
`endParValue` = 3350
